# Deep-Neural-Network-based-Approaches-in-Wind-Time-Series-Forecasting
This respiratory contains the implementation codes of wind-speed prediction in energy forecasting. This study focused on deep neural network based approaches, like the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous inputs (NARX), nonlinear input-output (NIO), and nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network models, in time-series forecasting applications. The idea was to propose NARX neural network based prediction models in wind-speed forecasting for the short-term scheme. The meteorological parameters related to wind time-series (e.g., temperature, pressure, wind speed, wind direction) were analyzed and used to evaluate the proposed models' performance.
